    <p>Actually, I'm well-rounded person. When I was young, I'm very greedy person. <br>
        Especially, I really wanted to learn about various fields.<Br>
        That's the reason that I have various information about several categories.<br>
    but I feel something lacking. Because I thnik I have to be more professional.<br>
    Although I know a number of information of several fields, I'm not a specaillist of one field but just a superficial knowledge.<br>
So I will work hard to be a expert of virous fields. I hope "Like Awesome Lion" will make me like that.</p>

        <p>My dream had been a lawyer. When I was middle school, my parent progressed a trial. That trial was too unfair to get compensation for damage.<br>
        I think wealth had a effect to the trial. After that, I decided to be a lawyer for ordinary person. Law survice is too expensive that ordinary person can't get proper survice.<br>
    So I wanted to give them great law survice for sensible price.<br>

But that made me idealist, finally made me empty. I need something for myself.<br>
For finding my dream, I scratch </p>
